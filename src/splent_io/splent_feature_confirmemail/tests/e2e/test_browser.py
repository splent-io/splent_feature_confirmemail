End-to-end tests for splent_feature_confirmemail.

E2E tests drive a real browser via Selenium against the running
application.  They are slow by design and should only verify
critical user flows that cannot be covered by functional tests.

Run with:  splent feature:test splent_feature_confirmemail --e2e
